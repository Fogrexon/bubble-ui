You are tasked with setting up a development environment for the following task:

{{args}}

Please proceed with the following steps:

1.  **Determine Branch Name**:
    -   Choose a specific and concise branch name based on the task description (e.g., `feature/cool-new-thing` or `fix/annoying-bug`).

2.  **Create Branch & Worktree**:
    -   To isolate your environment, please create a new git worktree inside the `worktrees` directory.
    -   Execute the following command to create the worktree and branch simultaneously:
        ```bash
        git worktree add worktrees/<branch_name> -b <branch_name>
        ```
    -   If worktrees are not feasible in the current environment, please checkout the branch in the current directory as a fallback.

3.  **Create Task Definition**:
    -   Navigate to the new worktree directory.
    -   Create a `TASK.md` file in the root of the worktree.
    -   In `TASK.md`, write a clear and detailed description of the task that needs to be implemented, based on the user's request above. This file will be used by the `task-impl` command.
    -   Finally, inform the user about the created worktree directory path.
