You are tasked with removing a git worktree.

Please remove the worktree located at the path provided in `{{args}}`.

Use the command: `git worktree remove {{args}}`

Important: If the worktree has uncommitted changes, the command will fail. In such cases, you might need to commit, stash, or use the `-f` option (force remove) if the user explicitly instructs it.
