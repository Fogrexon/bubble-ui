# Project Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the Bubble UI project.

Bubble UI is a library designed for building user interfaces with a focus on flexible styling and rendering. It aims to provide a lightweight and efficient way to define UI components and manage their presentation.

## Key Features

*   **Flexible Styling**: Easily apply and manage styles for your components.
*   **Cross-platform Potential**: Designed with an adaptable rendering layer.

## Architecture

The core of Bubble UI consists of:
*   **Core Renderer**: Manages the rendering process and abstraction over different platforms.
*   **Styling Engine**: Parses and applies style definitions.
*   **JSX Integration**: Provides a JSX transform for defining UI elements.
